# Osteoporosis Data Analysis
This project involves the analysis of osteoporosis data using SAS to predict the risk of developing the condition based on various health factors. The analysis includes data cleansing, frequency analysis, and graphical representation of key risk factors.

Tools and Techniques Used
SAS: For statistical analysis and data visualization.
PROC FREQ & PROC SGPLOT: Used for frequency analysis and plotting graphs for visualizing data patterns.
Steps Involved:
Data Cleansing

Performed data cleansing to remove duplicates and correct errors, ensuring the dataset is clean for analysis.
Statistical Analysis

Analyzed the percentage risk of osteoporosis using advanced statistical methods to predict risk factors associated with the condition.
Graphical Representation

Created graphs using PROC FREQ and PROC SGPLOT to visually represent the relationship between various health variables and the risk of osteoporosis
